data analytics project showcasing customer behaviour analysis using python sql and power Bi
📊 Data Analytics Project README
Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from data ingestion and exploration to database querying and business intelligence reporting. The goal is to extract actionable insights from raw data using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and communicate findings clearly through dashboards, reports, and presentations.

The project showcases practical data analytics skills commonly required in industry, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, and data visualization.

Dataset

Source: [Briefly describe where the dataset comes from – e.g., public dataset, company data, Kaggle, etc.]

Format: CSV

Description: The dataset contains structured data relevant to the analysis (e.g., sales, customer behavior, transactions, performance metrics).

Size: [Optional – number of rows/columns]

Tools & Technologies

Python: Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn

SQL (PostgreSQL): Querying data stored in a Neon cloud database

Neon: Serverless PostgreSQL database

Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation

Microsoft PowerPoint: Executive summary and presentation of insights

Project Steps

Data Loading

Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Performed initial inspection to understand structure and data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.

Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Data Cleaning

Handled missing and duplicate values.

Standardized column names and data formats.

Ensured data consistency for analysis and reporting.

Database Integration & SQL Analysis

Uploaded cleaned data to a Neon PostgreSQL database.

Ran SQL queries to answer business questions and generate summary tables.

Dashboard Development

Connected Power BI to the Neon database.

Built interactive dashboards with key KPIs, charts, and filters.

Reporting & Presentation

Created a written analytical report summarizing findings.

Designed a PowerPoint presentation to communicate insights to stakeholders.

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Trend and comparison visualizations

Interactive filters for deeper analysis

📌 Screenshots or a Power BI link can be added here if available.

Results & Insights

Identified key patterns and trends within the data.

Highlighted actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making.

Translated technical analysis into clear business recommendations.
